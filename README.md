# S.Park-Pinball
This s my homemade South-Park pinball machine. It is powered by MPF/OPP
Thanks to the guys at the <a href="https://github.com/missionpinball">Mission Pinball Project</a> and <a href="https://openpinballproject.wordpress.com/">Open Pinball Project</a> for all the support.

This is a work-in-progress. It may not run as is.

Due to copyright-limitations I can not upload the Audio and Video files. Sorry for that.
