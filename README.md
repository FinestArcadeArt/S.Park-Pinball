# S.Park-Pinball
This is my homemade South-Park pinball machine. It is powered by MPF/OPP
Thanks to the guys at the <a href="https://github.com/missionpinball">Mission Pinball Project</a> and <a href="https://openpinballproject.wordpress.com/">Open Pinball Project</a> for all the support.

This project is not intended to be used as is, instead it should help you designing your own game using .YAML files. If you have any question, feel free to contact me.

Due to copyright-limitations I can not upload the Audio and Video files. Sorry for that.
